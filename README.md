The information on Hospital Compare:

ii Encourages hospitals to improve the quality of care they provide 

### II. Motivation of the Patient Star Rating Analysis Project  
i There isnot many analysis avaiable online for patient to refer to  
ii There are a large amount of data on CMC web and I hope to use big data tools to analyze these data  
iii It will be very useful if patient can refer to the analysis before they randomly choose a care center  
iii It also equally important for hospitals to learn the patient feedback and improve their care system.

### III. Does the analysis tells anything about why some region hospitals are rated well and others not?  
i Combining the national census data I hope to understand if the population size is correlating with the rating  
ii What kind of recommendations should we give to government and hospitals?

The project is just started...
