# Patient_Star_Rating_Analysis
CMC (The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) updates hospital compare datasets a few times each year.  
(Hospital Compare data archive: https://data.medicare.gov/data/archives/hospital-compare)  
Public description of data source: https://www.medicare.gov/hospitalcompare/Data/Data-Updated.html#

### I. Why We Are Using Hospital Compare?
You can use Hospital Compare to find hospitals and compare the quality of their care. The information on Hospital Compare: Helps you make decisions about where you get your health care. Encourages hospitals to improve the quality of care they provide.

ii Encourages hospitals to improve the quality of care they provide 

### II. Motivation of the Patient Star Rating Analysis Project  
i There isnot many analysis avaiable online for patient to refer to  
ii There are a large amount of data on CMC web and I hope to use big data tools to analyze these data  
iii It will be very useful if patient can refer to the analysis before they randomly choose a care center  
iii It also equally important for hospitals to learn the patient feedback and improve their care system.

### III. Does the analysis tells anything about why some region hospitals are rated well and others not?  
i Combining the national census data I hope to understand if the population size is correlating with the rating  
ii Crowed state like California, NY, NJ, FL, etc showed the worst ratings.  
iii By finishing up the project, I hope to develop a hospital recommendation system for patients. 

The project is just started...
